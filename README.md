Extra functionality for CiviContribute

Administrative use of front-end contribution pages.
 
The backend contribution form is complicated and breaks when you have a ACH/EFT or other non-credit-card billing fields payment processor.

To solve that problem, and also provide a simpler, more tailored administrative data input screens, this extension allows you to mark a contribution page as 'Admin-linked'. This auto-links it from the individual contact page contribution tab.
Pages can also be identified as admin-only, making the page unavailable to the public.
