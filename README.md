Extra functionality for CiviContribute

## Administrative use of front-end contribution pages.
 
The backend contribution form is complicated and breaks when you have a ACH/EFT or other non-credit-card billing fields payment processor.

To solve that problem, and also provide a simpler, more tailored administrative data input screens, this extension allows you to mark a contribution page as 'Admin-linked'. This auto-links it from the individual contact page contribution tab.

Pages can also be identified as admin-only, making the page unavailable to the public.

## Extended Contributions Report

A version of a contributions report I use on most of my big projects. It doesn't do line items, but it does automatically roll up totals for all the columns you don't choose to display, and it does use the bookkeeping tables.
